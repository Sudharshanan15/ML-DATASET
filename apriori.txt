DESCRIPTION:
This algorithm is used to gain insight into the structure relationships between different items involved.
And also used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules.
It assumes that any subset of a frequent item set must be frequent.
Association rule mining is a technique to identify frequent patterns and association among a set of items.
